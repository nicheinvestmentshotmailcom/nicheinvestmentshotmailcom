- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gavin Nichols
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in extracting scientific research grade molllusc biodiversity occurrence records from posts made to a FB group called "Australian Mollusc Species on Facebook"
- I have no coding qualifictions but understand the datasets must use Darwin Core Terms and formats. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently intersted in how mistakes have been made in the GEORFERENCED RECORDS which includes the lcoation of the preserved specimen not the 
- location of where the specimen was found.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ; email me at nicheinvestments@hotmail.com
